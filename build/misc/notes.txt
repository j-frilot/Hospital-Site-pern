                    Face coverings, often called masks, can help stop
                    your germs from infecting others. Research has shown
                    that wearing masks reduces the risk of infection,
                    especially when combined with other prevention
                    efforts such as washing your hands often and staying
                    6 feet away from others.<br></br>
